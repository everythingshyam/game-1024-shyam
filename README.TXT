PROJECT TITLE: 1024 Game By Shyam

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Make a relatively simple game, revise java, and gain some programming confidence

VERSION or DATE: Last Updated On 13th November, 2021. Started on 13th November

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: N/A

AUTHORS: Shyam Sundar Tiwari(practicing alone)

USER INSTRUCTIONS: There is nothing special to tell you for running the code. Just run the MainClass and you'll be guided along the way. However, if you don't know about the 1024 game, you should google it before playing. It will help you to get started.
Coming to the programming part, I had already made this program (probably last year), but lost it's code somehow. But since I remember the process and mechanisms used, I'll be probably be able to finish the code way faster than what time it took on the first place. However, this time, plan is to use this program in making an android app for the game after finishing this project. Even if I don't have enough knowledge of android development, I am hopeful as being a programming lover from many years, its not that hard to get used to a development language. It's just that it takes sometime.

Myself Shyam.
